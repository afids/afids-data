## In this GitHub repo, you can find: 

1) data: Markups Comma-separated values file (i.e., *.fcsv extension) files for both templates and datasets. 
2) notebooks: Jupyter notebooks involved in creation of the JavaScript Object Notation (i.e., *.json) which is an adaptation from BIDS Appendix VIII on Coordinate systems.  
3) other: Information about rater experience, afids protocol, and interactive glass brain
